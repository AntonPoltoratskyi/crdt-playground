/* The Drawing Causal Tree looks a lot different from the Text Causal Tree. Our goal is to allow shapes to be grouped
 with their points and properties in the weave for O(shape) recreation. An atom can either be a shape, a point,
 an operation, or an attribute. Shapes can be caused only by other shapes as well as the zero atom; their weave order
 is their drawing order. On creation, shapes receive a blank ("root") atom, and all atoms relating to the shape will be
 linked to it. Points can be caused only by other points as well as their shape's root atom, for the first point
 in a shape; their weave order is their connection order. Operations can be caused only by other operations in their
 type group as well as a point atom or root atom, for the first operation in a chain. Operation types are currently
 divided into transformations (move) and deletions. Operations must be priority atoms. The same goes for attributes,
 which can be thought of as register-type operations; the last weave value in a chain is taken as the definitive one.
 Each attribute is considered its own type group; attributes of different types shall not mix causally. Finally, since
 we'll be traversing chains of operations quite frequently, we want to make sure that we can find the end of a chain in
 O(number of operations in chain) time and not O(N) time, which is what would be required if we do the usual awareness
 and causal block derivation dance. For this, each operation, attribute, and point (?) shall have a reference to its
 originating shape. */

/* How do we move an entire shape? Three possible ways:
 > move each individual point
 > add a "move" operation
 > implicitly, by moving the first point
 Moving each individual point is bad, b/c if another peer adds points then they won't get moved. So the choice is
 between an implicit operation and an explicit operation. Text editing works via implicit operations, i.e. every
 new character, instead of overwriting the previous character, implicitly shifts over every successive character.
 Here, for the sake of completeness, let's use operations. */

// this is where the CT structure is mapped to our local model
// AB: because I didn't want to deal with the extra complexity, shapes can't be deleted at the moment -- only points
//     (in terms of user-facing stuff, that is: under the hood the CT preserves everything anyway)
